# This is the R Script for creating the Plot5 graph for the Exploratory Data Analysis
# Peer Assesment 2.
# The data is contained in two files summarySCC_PM25.rds and Source_Classification_Code.rds.

# The requirement for this plot is:
# How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999â€“2008 in Baltimore City?
